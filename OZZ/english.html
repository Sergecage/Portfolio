		<p>First time in OZZ club - the participants of the festival «Уральская ночь музыки – Ural Music Night» bands from Birmingham Riscas and The Assist.
You couldn't belive!!! – the entrance free!!!!!!!!

Riscas and  The Assist — followers of the traditions of Britpop and are distinguished by the very "British" sound of rock and roll music of the 60s - 70s.

The British press calss  The Assist «the discovery of music from Birmingham», praising them for its incredible energy and non-standard approach to pop music.
Clutching guitar riffs, catchy choruses and incredible energy have brought young artist on the same stage with Rat Boy – the main pop-punk artist of the modern British scene and the winner of «NME Awards» in the category of the best young artist. The Assist performed with the participants of Manchester charts Blossoms, with the leader of iconic Happy Monday’s, Shaun Ryder, and played European tour together with Black Honey.
The Assist participated in major music festivals: Leeds & Reading, Isle of Wight, TRNSMT, YNot, Kendal Calling. The Assist was also played at the Live at Leeds festival. Steve Lamacq and Tom Robinson from BBC Radio 6 gave the band positive reviews and supported their work. </p><br><img src="https://pp.userapi.com/c852120/v852120475/1397a1/bUIa7Ng02oU.jpg" alt="BritRock">

		<p> Just a few people know that Victor Tsoi has perfomed in 1987 in the neighboring building from Ozz club. And probably even passed by our building 22 years ago, and did not know that when there will be a club here, where the two-meter-long painting of him will hang!
The group "KINO" performed in a strange place - the assembly hall of the club of Chelzabinsk Polztechnic Institute (South Ural State University now).
Local party officials and the police were against the concert, but the rector German Vyatkin ( "The Handsome") allowed to organize live show under his personal responsibility. Of course, there was a sell-out - the cherry had nowhere to fall, neither the apple,
exactly like that!
Here is one of the few photos from the concert!!!
Here is a corner of the history on our wall!
p.s. We are waiting for everyone on this Friday - It would be a party - it seems like Viktor Tsoi would like this party)</p>
